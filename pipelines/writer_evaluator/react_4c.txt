In Reading Comprehension assessments, a **Factual Information Question** evaluates a reader’s ability to understand and recall explicitly stated facts in a passage.
This question type presents a **reading passage** along with a **statement**, and the examinee must determine whether the statement is supported by the factual content of the passage.

Example (Factual Information Question)

Passage:
Many birds fly south for the winter to find warmer weather and more food. Some birds travel thousands of kilometers to reach their destination. The Arctic Tern, for example, migrates from the Arctic to Antarctica each year. Migration helps birds survive harsh conditions during the colder months.

Statement:
The Arctic Tern migrates from Antarctica to the Arctic every winter.

Your task is to generate a **passage–statement pair** suitable for a **factual information question**, where a reader must decide whether the statement is supported by the passage. 
The passage must be based on the facts presented in the given **Source Text**.
Generate a passage and a statement that satisfy all of the following attributes. 
Make sure you strictly follow the definition of each attribute and value.

Attribute Definitions:

1. Passage Length
   The number of sentences in the passage:
   - short: 6-15 sentences
   - medium: 16–20 sentences
   - long: 21-30 sentences

2. Sentence Length
   The number of words per sentence in the passage:
   - short: 15 words or fewer
   - medium: 16–20 words
   - long: more than 20 words

3. Vocab Level
   All words in the passage and statement must belong to or be simpler than the given CEFR level:
   - A: A1–A2 only
   - B: B1–B2 or lower
   - C: C1–C2 or lower
   You must include at least one word from the specified level. Do not use words above the level.

4. Statement Propositions
   A proposition is an atomic, self-contained unit of meaning. The number of propositions in the statement must equal the given value. Each proposition should convey a distinct fact or claim.
   The statement must be written as a **single sentence**. Even if it contains multiple propositions, they must be expressed within a single, grammatically correct sentence.
   **Single-proposition statement example**
   - The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris.
   - Elephants are the largest land animals.
   - Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world.
   **Two-proposition statement example**
   - She practices every day to improve her piano skills. (She practices every day. & She practices to improve her piano skills.)
   - The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris and was completed in 1889. (The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris. & he Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889.)
   - Painted with vibrant colors, the building stands out among the gray surroundings. (The building was painted with vibrant colors. & The building stands out among the gray surroundings.)

Solve an educational item generation task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps.
Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be six types:
(1) Write_Sentence[(i) sentence]
   - Writes the i-th sentence of the passage, which should be used when the passage currently has i−1 sentences.
(2) Insert_Sentence[(i) sentence]
   - Inserts a new sentence before the i-th sentence of the passage.
(3) Remove_Sentence[i]
   - Removes the i-th sentence of the passage.
(4) Revise_Sentence[(i) sentence]
   - Revises the i-th sentence of the passage.
(5) Write_Statement[statement]
   - Writes a statement. You can use this action when you write the statement for the first time or write a new statement targeting a different part of the passage.
(6) Revise_Statement[statement]
   - Revises the statement that has been previously written.
At each step, you must take exactly one of these six actions, and must strictly follow the exact format.

Here is an example.

Source Text:
    In recent years, the food industry in China has been under intense scrutiny due to a series of alarming food scandals that have shaken public confidence in what is on our plates. The widespread number of food scandals in China is making many people pause before they put their chopsticks in their mouths. Consumers are left contemplating the safety of the food they are about to consume, wondering if it is clean, healthy, and nutritious, or if it contains something harmful that could potentially cause disease. \n\nThe dilemma becomes even more complicated when we consider the nature of our modern diet. Most of the food we eat today is processed food. This particular phenomenon means that the foods we buy in stores and supermarkets, especially packaged foods, are typically prepared in factories where various substances\u2014often chemicals\u2014are added during production. These chemicals serve multiple purposes: they are intended to enhance the appearance of the food, improve its flavor, and extend its shelf life. \n\nLegally, these chemicals are supposed to be harmless, and there are regulations in place that dictate which chemicals can and cannot be utilized in food production. However, in practice, these laws are not always strictly enforced, and some producers take the risk of flouting these regulations. For example, a recent investigation uncovered that a producer of steamed buns in Zhejiang Province was discovered to be breaking the law. He was caught adding yellow dye and other banned chemicals to his buns and even resorted to recycling old buns, using them to make new buns that were sold to unsuspecting customers\u2014most of whom were students in schools. \n\nThis raises a critical question: Why did he engage in such reckless and unethical practices? Why did he break the law and endanger people's health? The answer is simple and upsetting: he wanted to make more money. This moral failing echoes throughout the food scandal landscape in China and illustrates a troubling trend. In an era of rapid economic development and fierce competition, it seems that too many individuals and companies are primarily focused on financial gain, often neglecting the moral and ethical implications of their actions on public health and safety. The repeated instances of compromised food standards remind us of the importance of accountability and integrity in our food systems, and the urgent need for overall reform in the industry to prioritize consumer well-being over profit.
Constraints:
    - Passage Length: medium
    - Sentence Length: medium
    - Vocab Level: B
    - Statement Propositions: 2

Thought 1: To begin, I need to construct a medium-length passage (16–20 sentences), where each sentence has 16–20 words, uses vocabulary at CEFR level B (B1–B2 or lower), and is based entirely on the source text. The passage must accurately reflect explicitly stated facts. I will also ensure that at least one B-level word (like “scrutiny,” “regulations,” “producers,” or “investigation”) is used.
Then, I’ll write a single sentence statement containing two distinct factual propositions that may or may not be supported by the passage.
I’m going to write a passage consisting of approximately 18 sentences. I’ll now start writing the passage, sentence by sentence, using the “Write_Sentence” action.
Action 1: Write_Sentence[(1) In recent years, China’s food industry has faced growing public concern due to repeated food safety scandals.]
Observation 1:
- The number of sentences in the passage: 1 -> (unsatisfied)
- The number of words per sentence in the passage:
sentence (1) - 18 words -> (satisfied)
- Vocabulary Levels used in the passage:
A1-A2: ['food', 'growing', 'repeated', 'years', 'industry', 'recent', 'public']
B1-B2: ['concern', 'scandals', 'faced', 'safety']
C1-C2: []
-> (satisfied)
- Vocabulary Levels used in the statement: -
- Statement Propositions: -
Thought 2: Now I’ll continue building the passage by writing the second sentence, maintaining the 16–20 word range and using vocabulary at or below B2 level, based on the source text.
Action 2: Write_Sentence[(2) These scandals have led people to scrutinize the authenticity and integrity of the food they regularly consume.]
Observation 2:
- The number of sentences in the passage: 2 -> (unsatisfied)
- The number of words per sentence in the passage:
sentence (1) - 18 words -> (satisfied)
sentence (2) - 17 words -> (satisfied)
- Vocabulary Levels used in the passage:
A1-A2: ['repeated', 'people', 'growing', 'public', 'led', 'recent', 'food', 'industry', 'years']
B1-B2: ['concern', 'scandals', 'consume', 'safety', 'faced', 'regularly']
C1-C2: ['integrity']
-> (unsatisfied)
- Vocabulary Levels used in the statement: -
- Statement Propositions: -
Thought 3: Sentence (2) contains the word "integrity," which is C1-level and exceeds the allowed B-level vocabulary constraint. I need to revise this sentence to remove the C1-level word while keeping the meaning aligned with the source and preserving the sentence length.
Action 3: Revise_Sentence[(2) These scandals have led people to examine the honesty and quality of the food they regularly consume.]
Observation 3:
- The number of sentences in the passage: 2 -> (unsatisfied)
- The number of words per sentence in the passage:
sentence (1) - 18 words -> (satisfied)
sentence (2) - 17 words -> (satisfied)
- Vocabulary Levels used in the passage:
A1-A2: ['repeated', 'growing', 'public', 'led', 'industry', 'quality', 'years', 'people', 'food', 'recent']
B1-B2: ['regularly', 'honesty', 'safety', 'faced', 'concern', 'scandals', 'examine', 'consume']
C1-C2: []
-> (satisfied)
- Vocabulary Levels used in the statement: -
- Statement Propositions: -
Thought 4: I’ll continue expanding the passage while maintaining the medium sentence length and B-level vocabulary. I’ll ensure each fact is clearly tied to the source text and directly supports potential factual information questions.
Action 4: Write_Sentence[(3) Many of the foods people buy today are processed and prepared in factories before reaching the stores.]
